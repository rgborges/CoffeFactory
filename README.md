# CoffeeFactory
Coffee Factory is a project intended to fill some technology gaps in a café business. 
This is for my personal testing purpose, just to develop a business context base 
in order to apply dotnet and other tech projects. The ideia in the first place is to develop a console client for testing and improve to a clinent-server architecture using http client and a web minal API project.


## Console App

Is meant to be the client for developer usage only. 

## Minimal API

Is meant to deliver the main business information and interface to some actions:

- Get product prices based on a product catalog from the business.
- Request an coffee buy order for a worker (the café unit or a coffee machine) start to prepare the coffee requested.

## Final steps

Refactore the project to scalate using Azure Cloud services.
